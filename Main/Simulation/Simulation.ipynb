    "# Bornholdt Ising Model Simulation Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook runs and manages a **Bornholdt-style Ising model** for financial markets, simulating collective market behavior through interacting spins. It uses **Numba-accelerated Monte Carlo sweeps** for speed and saves all results neatly into a `Sim_Datasets/` folder beside the script.\n",
    "\n",
    "The setup begins by checking for existing simulation outputs, reporting which parameter combinations already exist and which are missing. Each simulation evolves a 2D spin grid with periodic boundaries, where the local field depends on neighboring spins and a global “frozen” magnetization term. After a burn-in phase, magnetization values are recorded, their differences computed as returns, and results saved to compressed `.npz` files with full metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code sweeps through parameter grids of `J`, `α`, and `β`, skipping any completed runs, ensuring efficiency and reproducibility. A helper function, `load_sim()`, easily reloads data for analysis. Overall, the notebook automates simulation management, data storage, and efficient computation in a clean, reproducible workflow.\n"
